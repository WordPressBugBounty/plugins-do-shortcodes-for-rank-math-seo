Display shortcodes in the title, description, Facebook and Twitter fields, and other locations for Rank Math SEO.

== Description ==

The Rank Math SEO Pack plugin does not provide the feature to do/display/show/execute WordPress shortcodes which are entered in the fields for title and description, Open Graph and others for the posts, pages, and other custom post types. This plugin converts all those shortcodes in the mentioned fields to their corresponding values as expected.

Please check the plugin settings page `Do Shortcodes for Rank Math SEO` menu under the `Denra Plugins` admin menu.
